below now works correctly.

- the crafter statue is locked in the beginning (only for those two recipes!) which is shown by the red light it has
- when the Crafting recipe is unlocked, the statue turns green, when Blacksmithing is unlocked, it turns blue, when both are unlocked, the light turns white
